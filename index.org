* A Hitchhiker's guide to High Energy Physics
** Preface
Wow! I wrote this approximately eight years ago. The following is... a
lot. I wrote it during the evening to unwind, and I was reading the
Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy so I took every opportunity to make
esoteric references to Douglas Adams. I think each individual section
is still pretty readable, and a lot of the information is evergreen.
The link density and trivia is insane. Distance has made me realize
that its fairly overwhelming. Now that I've been outside HEP for a few
years (almost five!) I understand just how intense getting into
research is. It doesn't look like its gotten better, ROOT transitioned
to cmake, most projects are on git, and a decent fraction appear to
have double-downed on docker.

I've updated some of the prescriptions to future-proof them and fixed
some link-rot. If you're a [[mailto:hhg-svc@ccbar.us][fan say so]]! I occasionally stalk the
internet and find references to it so I know there are some readers.

If you're getting into this business today, emphasize learning
transferable skills.  Learn how to write maintainable C++, learn
docker, learn how to use Jupyter notebooks, only use ROOT if you have
to (the rest of Data Science uses numpy, pandas, and python).

If I were to write this again today, it would sound very different,
but I'm still very proud of it

** Introduction
Welcome to High Energy Physics.  Like the Galaxy, HEP is a wonderful
and mysterious place filled with amazing things.  The intent of this
guide is to provide a jump-start to HEP research.  Its purpose is to
be entertaining and uninformative.  The information in this guide was
hard won, The Editor does not intend it to be different for our dear
reader.  This guide is not intended to make the reader's life easier.
It is not intended to teach anything.  It is intended to provide the
dear reader with a glossary of concepts for further research.

If the reader finds this guide entertaining, but uninformative, then
please send a bottle of Old Janx Spirit to The Editor. The Guide is
not intended to be read linearly.  Jump to the section in need, and if
that section contains links to other sections, then please see above
regarding edits. Prepare to be frustrated.

*** Navigating the guide
A note on key notation: Keys sequences follow the "emacs" style for
notating keys.  Therefore "=C-c=" means hold down the control key,
while pressing the =c= key. "=M-a=" would mean hold down the "Meta" key
and press the =a= key.  On most keyboards the Meta key is the key
labeled "Alt".  There is also the "Super" key, on most PC keyboards
this key has the "Windows icon" on it.  The function keys 1-12 are
notated as =F1= etc.  The escape key is usually notated =ESC=, and
the enter key is notated =RET= for Return.  A sequence is denoted by
a series of keys and spaces or dashes.  A dash means hold the two
keys at the same time, a space means release the previous keys and
continue with the next instruction.  Some examples:
- "=C-c C-a=" Control-C release Control-A
- "=C-c a=" Control-c release A
- "=C-M-f=" Press Control, then Meta, then F without releasing

The online version of the guide includes a Table of Contents; simply
mouse over it and a full list of topics will pop up.  You can click
any topic to jump to that section.  If you read this in org-mode, the
file will open folded.  It will look like:

Place your cursor at the beginning of =* A Hitchhiker's...= and hit
=TAB=, this will expand the topics allowing you to see and over-view
of the document.  Move to whichever topic you're interested in and
hit =TAB= again to expand that section.  

If you are reading this in Vim without [[https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode][Vim-OrgMode]], then you will
have no folding and the whole document will be expanded.  Jump to
various headlines by searching for "=**=" (two levels deep),
"=***=" (three levels deep), "=****=" (four levels deep), etc.  

If you are reading this as a PDF, there is no Table of Contents. Just
scroll to the section you are interested in.  

*NOTE* If you are reading this on GitHub, a link to another section
will probably be broken due to a bug in how GitHub parses org-flavored
markdown.

** For Windows Hitchhikers
Everyone should read [[For Linux Hitchhikers]] to understand what
functionality they'll need (especially when working with or on remote
machines)

While it is possible to practice HEP from the comfort of Bill Gates'
brain child, it is not recommended by The Editor.  (He doesn't
run Windows anyway, daylight scares him.) If you insist on using
Windows, the following is a list of useful software.
*** Software you will need
- [[For Linux Hitchhikers]]
- [[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html][PuTTY (ssh client for Windows)]]: Secure SHell is the standard way of
  accessing *nix machines remotely.  PuTTY is the Windows client for
  this.
- [[*ROOT][ROOT]]: The industry standard for High Energy Physics analysis.
   Beware: this program uses an [[https://sites.google.com/site/h2g2theguide/Index/i/149246][Infinite Improbability Drive]] to
   perform analysis.  
- [[http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/][Xming an X11 server for Windows]]: This allows you to tunnel X11
  applications (ROOT's histogram interface) to your Windows desktop,
  this way your data (and ROOT) can live on a remote machine, but you
  can still interact with them as if they were on your desktop.  (You
  need a *fast* internet connection to do this). Xming comes in two
  flavors: the "web" version, which is locked behind a paywall for
  people who donate to the project, and a slightly less up-to-date
  public version available for free.  Choose the public version. See
  [[http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/#sect-143][Getting Started]] and [[http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/trouble.php#head-11][Trouble shooting]] for tips on getting set up.
- [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install][WSL]]: Windows 10 released a Linux subsystem that allows a unix-like
  environment in Windows.
- [[http://cygwin.com/][Cygwin]]: Adds a substrate of the GNU system to Windows (in addition
  to an [[http://x.cygwin.com/][X11 server]]), you can use this to create a more Unix-like
  environment to work from. 
- [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][VirtualBox]]: Allows you to boot operating systems within operating
  systems (useful if you don't want to dual boot Ubuntu) see [[For Linux
  Hitchhikers]] after you've setup a working distro.

[[https://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox][See here]] for a nice picture-book tutorial on installing Ubuntu
through VirtualBox on Windows.
** For Linux Hitchhikers
*** Software you will need
 - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/][Screen]]: This lets you pick up where you left off if your ssh
   connection drops, [[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-gnu_screen/][here]] is a good conceptual introduction.  If you
   use =screen= on =lxplus=, you'll have to re-initialize your
   kerberos tokens after logging in with =kinit -5=, otherwise you
   won't have read access to your files.
 - [[https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki][tmux]]: Offers the same features as screen.
 - [[*ROOT][ROOT]]: The industry standard for High Energy Physics analysis.
   Beware: this program uses an [[https://sites.google.com/site/h2g2theguide/Index/i/149246][Infinite Improbability Drive]] to
   perform analysis.  
 - [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BashScripting][BASH]]: The command shell of choice for ATLAS Physicists.  You may
   think you could use ZSH, but it's better just to stick with
   what everyone else uses.  CMS Physicists prefer TCSH for some
   weird reason.
 - [[*Editors][Editor]]: Choose you're religion wisely, it will eventually permeate
   your being and change the way you approach life in general.
*** The Terminal
You will, regardless of which operating system you use, be typing
commands into a terminal.  It's inevitable, powerful, and intimidating
to new users.  HEP hitchhikers should feel at home.  Proficiency with
the command line is essential to being a functioning HEP researcher.

The terminal is like the Galaxy Hitchhiker's [[https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Towel][utility towel]]. Every
hitchhiker needs a terminal, and each hitchhiker customizes his or
her towel to their needs.  

If you've never touched a terminal before, and don't know what the
command line is, there are two options:
1. The [[http://lab.demog.berkeley.edu/Docs/12important/12important.pdf][great pedagogical introduction ]] (12 page PDF) by Carl Mason
2. "[[http://www.oliverelliott.org/article/computing/tut_unix/][An Introduction to Unix]]" (a comprehensive, modern take on the unix
   ecosystem) by Oliver Elliott

You should read both, Carl Mason's tutorial should be read
"cover-to-cover", where as Oliver's is written very much in the spirit
of this guide, so bookmark it and refer to it after you've read Carl
Mason's tutorial.
**** Line Editing
Most modern operating systems' default shell is bash.  Be aware that
bash's line editor is set up to respect emacs keybindings, this means
"C-a" is beginning of line "C-e" the end, etc. You can change to vi
bindings by typing:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
set -o vi
#+END_SRC
If you forget which mode your in, check it by typing:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
set -o
#+END_SRC
If you want these changes to be permanent, add them to your =.bashrc=.
If these commands give you an error, type:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo $SHELL
#+END_SRC
And see what it says (=/bin/bash= if it's bash, may be =/bin/zsh= or
=/bin/tcsh=). If it is not bash, then you need to google information
for the line editor of whichever shell you are using.  
**** Managing Jobs
Sometimes it will be convenient to spawn a process and continue
working in the current shell.  Usually this is accomplished by
redirecting the stdout and stderr to a file:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
myLongRunningCommand foo bar baz 42 &> theProcess.log &
#+END_SRC
When you launch the command, you'll see something like:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[1] 19509
#+END_EXAMPLE
The number =19509= is the PID of the process.  If you have multiple
jobs going they can be summarized by typing =jobs=
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[1]   Running                 myLongRunningCommand foo bar baz 42 &> theProcess.log &
[2]-  Running                 myLongRunningCommand foo bar baz 41 &> theProcess.log &
[3]+  Running                 myLongRunningCommand foo bar baz 40 &> theProcess.log &
#+END_EXAMPLE
Occasionally you'll realize that you don't want the jobs to run
anymore, so to kill them:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
kill %2
#+END_SRC
where =%1= is the job number you are referencing.  You'll see
something like:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[2]-  Terminated              myLongRunningCommand foo bar baz 41 &> theProcess.log &
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Configuring SSH
Many of these tips are [[http://blogs.perl.org/users/smylers/2011/08/ssh-productivity-tips.html][lifted from here]].
Put this in your =~/.ssh/config= file:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath /tmp/ssh_mux_%h_%p_%r
ControlPersist yes
ServerAliveInterval 30
ServerAliveCountMax 1
#+END_EXAMPLE
It is possible to setup ssh shorthand to route you to remote
machines. The syntax (in =~/.ssh/config=) is:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Host shortname
  #expands to shortname.remote.location.edu
  HostName %h.remote.location.edu 
  User username
  ForwardX11 yes #this is equivalient to ssh -Y
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa #path to your pubkey
#+END_EXAMPLE
**** SSH Keys
[[https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys][Follow this guide]], stop at step 3.
Now, when you need to start using a new machine:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ssh-copy-id user@remote.machine.name
#+END_EXAMPLE
Then enter your password.  Now, when you type =ssh
user@remote.machine.name= you will authenticate yourself with your
newly minted RSA key, and you won't have to enter your password.  The
downside is that you'll have to enter your key's passphrase to unlock
it. See below for a way to unlock it once per session.

*NOTE* While it is cryptographically more secure to authenticate
yourself with ssh keys, if your machine is compromised (ie stolen or
hacked) your ssh keys can provide the attacker with easier access to
all the machines you had access to.  This means you should:
1. Use a strong pass *phrase*, not password.  You need to maximize the 
   number of bits of entropy in your key in order to make it
   difficult to crack should the keys fall into enemy hands.  
2. Inform the admins of any machines you had access to if your
   machine is compromised
3. Encrypt your ssh keys (and other sensitive information) in a
   private directory that only you can access
4. *NEVER EVER* store your ssh keys on a third party site (like
   Dropbox or similar services)
**** SSH Agent
If you have ssh-agent running (through the =gnome-keyring= service on
Ubuntu, or directly in your .xinitrc through =ssh-agent blah=) you
can type =ssh-add= when you log in and it will add your ssh key to
the keyring, then you can ssh to any machine that you have copied
your key to without entering the password! 

*NOTE* Once you've added your key to the ssh-agent, anyone can sit
down at your keyboard and log into a remote machine as you! This
means if you step away from your computer (even for a moment) you
should lock the screen or log out.  

*** Version Control Systems
The major version control systems in HEP is Git. Git is a series of
tools and utilities to allow collaboration on large pieces of
software.

Git also provides programmers with a convenient "paper trail" through
the course of developing a piece of software.  It allows them to
revert the source code they are working on to any state that they've
previously checked in.

Git is a software that was written by Linus Torvalds, the hacker
behind Linux.  It was written to manage the Linux kernel, a massive
piece of software.  Git's model for managing source code is slightly
different.  In Git, you maintain the entire repository in your local
copy.  This makes committing, managing, and branching very fast.  It
also means you can work with all of the advantages of a version
control system without internet access.  Simultaneously there is a
copy of the repository on a remote server.  Git handles syncing these
two repositories when instructed.  This can lead to confusion if
you've used other versioning systems, but shouldn't be a problem if
you have no expectations.

- [[https://ochronus.com/git-tips-from-the-trenches/][Git tips from the trenches]]
*** *rc Files
 =*rc= files are special files that are executed every time a program
 starts. They almost exclusively live in the user's home directory,
 and can be shadowed by the system.  Sometimes they have a special
 syntax for setting options, sometimes they are written in a scripting
 language.  The most relevant rc files for a new hitchhiker are:
- .rootrc :: the file that sets root options
- .bashrc :: this is executed every time you open a terminal in bash
- .tcshrc :: as above but for tcsh (hopefully you aren't using this!)
- .zshrc :: as above for the zsh shell
- .vimrc :: configuration options for the venerable vim editor
- .screenrc :: options for gnu screen
- .emacs :: written in emacs lisp, is executed on startup, breaks the
            rc naming scheme.  Advanced emacs users have
            multi-thousand line rc files

There are other files, if you want to know about them you can do:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ls .*rc
#+END_SRC
And google the ones that look interesting.  Alternatively you can look
at the system defaults:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ls /etc/*rc
#+END_SRC
Sometimes its useful to copy the system file to your home directory
and then edit it there in order to add your customizations.  Some
programs document their options that way.

In recent years programs have begun migrating to putting their
configuration files and options the =.config= subdirectory in a user's
=$HOME= directory.

** For Mac OS X Hitchhikers
Everyone should read [[For Linux Hitchhikers]]
 to understand what
functionality they'll need (especially when working with or on remote
machines).  As a Mac user, you should also read "[[http://www.insectnation.org/blog/it-just-works-or-does-it-the-dark-side-of-macs-in-hep.html][It just works... or
does it? The dark side of Macs in HEP]]" by Andy Buckley.  It explains
in detail issues with software development on a Mac.  It is an opinion
piece, so don't expect it to be balanced. Also, consider asking your
supervisor for an account on a Linux box and *never look back.* 
*** Software you will need
 - [[http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/][XQuartz]]: Like XMing for Windows, XQuartz runs a local X11 server
   for tunneling X11 applications over SSH, unlike Windows, you don't
   need a separate SSH program, ssh is built in.
 - [[https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac][Terminal.app]]: This is Mac OS's default terminal emulator. It comes
   with Mac OS, so you shouldn't need to install it.  You should be
   aware of it though.
 - [[*ROOT][ROOT]]: The industry standard for High Energy Physics analysis.
   Beware: this program uses an [[https://sites.google.com/site/h2g2theguide/Index/i/149246][Infinite Improbability Drive]] to
   perform analysis.  
 - [[http://aquamacs.org/][Aquamacs]]: A port of Emacs that uses Aqua as a standard OS X
   application. This integrates Emacs with the Mac OS UI.  In the
   long history of corporate acquisitions a lot of Emacs hackers (from
   NeXTSTEP) ended up at apple, you will find that Mac OS integrates
   the Emacs experience much more fundamentally than any other OS in
   existance. (This doesn't mean you need to use Emacs if you use Mac
   OS, just that your muscle memory will thank you subconsciously.)
 - [[https://www.macports.org/install.php][MacPorts]]: A system for compiling and installing open source
   software on the Mac
 - [[http://brew.sh][Home Brew]]: A package manager for Mac OS, allowing you to install
   various utilities that don't necessarily come pre-installed with
   Mac OS. 
** Editors
Like the major world religions, there are also major editors.  In
the *nix ecosystem there are two main editors: Emacs and Vim. There are
others, but they are many, and beyond the scope of this guide.  

The most important thing to do after [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1430164/differences-between-Emacs-and-vim][choosing an editor]] is to work
through its corresponding tutorial. An oft heard recommendation is
that "Emacs is easier to learn than vi(m)". A more accurate statement
may be that it is easier to make things happen in Emacs than Vim, but
the two editors are in some sense the yin and yang of text. True
enlightenment in either of these editors takes roughly the same amount
of time after completing the corresponding tutorial.

*** Finding an editor Guru
After you have finished the tutorial for your editor of choice, then
it's time to find a guru.  Guru's are best located by asking around.
If you are talking with someone and notice they use your editor,
don't be afraid to ask them how they did something. Most of the time
the Guru will be flattered and may even volunteer to help you with
any other editor related questions.  
**** Editor Guru etiquette
While it is generally OK to ask your Guru any editor related
question, it is best to keep questions restricted to the editor in
question.  Flame wars have been fought for decades over which is the
"one true editor." 

In order to prevent a /faux pas/, it is best to make sure you know which
editor your guru uses.  This is especially true in the case of a
vi(m) or Emacs guru. 

Another thing to be careful of is repeatedly asking basic questions.
Again, some gurus will tolerate this at the beginning, but after a
point the guru expects you to master the basics (on your own). The
most valuable knowledge your guru can impart is not written in the
tutorial that came with the editor.
**** Keeping your Guru happy
Guru's subsist mainly on a liquid diet of caffeinated beverages
during the day and beer (occasionally wine) at night.  It is
important that your Guru remain well lubricated. It is generally
considered a good gesture to offer your Guru his/her beverage of
choice if you've found him/her to be especially helpful on your path
to enlightenment. 
*** Emacs
The end goal of any student of the [[http://www.jwz.org/hacks/why-cooperation-with-rms-is-impossible.mp3][Church of Emacs]] is to obtain
proficiency reprogramming the editor to solve the task at hand.  This
is ultimately stems from the philosophy of lisp (this gift was given
to us by [[http://www.stallman.org/saint.html][St. IGNUcious]] an AI hacker from MIT where Emacs was born).
In lisp, the flexibility of the language allows it to be re-written to
solve the problem as clearly as possible.  In Emacs, an enlightened
user will write a substrate of elisp (Emacs' dialect of lisp) in order
to solve the editing problem at hand.

While customizing and writing your .emacs (the initialization file
loaded by Emacs in your home directory) is a spiritual journey, there
are those who have done their best to illuminate the path. [[http://www.dialectical-computing.de/blog/blog/2014/03/02/a-simple-emacs-configuration/][A brief
guide to customization philosophies here]].

The Editor finds the following packages essential:
- [[info:tramp#Top][tramp]]: If your reading this in Emacs, you can follow the link with
  "C-c C-o". It is *the* most important aspect of Emacs for HEP
  users. It allows you to "visit" files on remote machines from the
  Emacs running on your desktop.  It does this through ssh.  To visit
  a remote file, type "C-x C-f" and then type
  '/ssh:user@remote.host:~/remote/path', note that tab completion
  works remotely just the same as visiting a file locally! Tramp is
  also aware of ssh aliases in =~/.ssh/config=, see [[Configuring SSH]].
- [[info:calc#Top][Calc]] - ""Calc" is an advanced desk calculator and mathematical tool
  written by Dave Gillespie that runs as part of the GNU Emacs
  environment." It handles barns and electron volts out of the box!
- [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FillAdapt][filladapt]]: a mode for more intelligently filling text in paragraphs
- [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlySpell][flyspell]]: a spell checker that highlights mispelled words (will check
  in comments if in a programming mode)
- [[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/RectangleMark][rect-mark]]: Adds facilities for marking yanking and otherwise
  editing columnar formatted text. 
- [[info:emacs#Dired][dired]] (another info link): a directory editor for manipulating files
  in the Emacs way
- [[http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized][solarized-theme]]: A theme by Ethan Schoonover, comes in dark and
  light variants that actually complement each other well, another
  good one is zenburn or gruvbox
- [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IbufferMode][ibuffer]]: changes the buffer interface and allows you to group
  buffers based on various buffer attributes
- [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit][paredit]]: Enhances Emacs's awareness of parenthetic structure 
- [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens]]: Electrically pairs and deletes delimeters when
  appropriate (never miss a closing brace again!)
- [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AutoComplete][auto-complete]]: When setup properly, tab completes anything at any
  point depending on past input or names in other buffers.
- [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AUCTeX][auctex]]: LaTeX editing facilities (for when org-mode doesn't quite cut
  it)
- [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]: This guide is written in org-mode. Org-mode can manage
  [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/orgtutorial_dto.html][todo lists]], [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-web.html][write websites]], serve as a [[https://github.com/dmb2/research-log][lab notebook]], execute code
  for [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][literate programming]] and many other things.  More relevant for
  physicists is the [[http://ehneilsen.net/notebook/orgExamples/org-examples.html][org-mode cookbook]]. People switch to Emacs just to

*** Vim
If Emacs is like Catholicism, then Vim is like Buddhism.  Vim is the
modern incarnation of vi, a modal text editor that descended from ed.
The modal way of editing is by expressing in a few keystrokes how the
text should be manipulated.  This is in contrast to Emacs, where text
is manipulated directly.  This fundamental difference is the source of
much confusion for new users, and is also why many people recommend
Emacs as "being easier to learn." This should not deter new users from
learning vi(m), as its editing facilities are substantial.

A functional =.vimrc= looks like:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
syntax on
set cursorline
set hlsearch
set ic
set incsearch
set ruler
set shiftwidth=4
set tabstop=4
set wrap
#+END_EXAMPLE

To learn Vim, type =vimtutor= at the command lime and follow the
instructions. Take your time, and repeat the tutorial once or twice
over a few days.  In the mean time editors such as =gedit= or =nano=
offer a more traditional experience.  As your Vim skills improve, you
will feel more comfortable with Vim and can stop using the less
powerful editors.

** Software Design
Well designed software is a true marvel, in the same way architecture
is a marvel.  You are a stone mason, and you are building a cathedral.
Repeat that last sentence every time you want to take a shortcut when
coding. A cathedral can't stand on a flimsy foundation.

In order to help you on your way, you should read the following:

- [[https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code][How to Write Unmaintainable Code]] (*warning*, many physicists take this
  guide literally)

Good software design is *very* hard, but when you have the pleasure of
using well designed software, it is a true joy. Some examples of good

** A brief introduction to C++ 
*Caveat Emptor* This information was written for C++03, it was old when
I wrote it (2014), C++11 was too shiny and new.  Now in 2022, C++11 is old
and crufty. Modern C++ memory management looks very different than it
did a decade ago. I've been out of the game too long to know what HEP
is doing... They're probably using C++11.

C++ is the industry standard programming language for analysis in
HEP.  Even if you are fortunate enough to do most of your work in
Python, you will eventually be calling C++ code, and should
understand some core concepts in order to debug problems should they
arise.

Things to keep in mind: 
- This portion of the guide covers C++ at a high level.  Very little
  [[http://www.cplusplus.com/tutorial][specific syntax]] will be covered.  When you have a C++ question,
  google is your friend.
- When writing in any language, prefer that languages idioms.  Don't
  write python in C++, C in C++ or C++ in python.
- C++ is a vast language, however being familiar with its roots, C,
  is invaluable.
- If faced with a decision between learning C++ vs Python, prefer
  C++.  C++'s syntax is more rigid and requires more overhead.  Once
  you know C++, python is much easier to pick up.
- There's always an exception to the rule, just make sure it's the
  right exception!

C++ is an imperative, object oriented language.  It started out as a
"C with classes" but has since bolted on significant language
features different from C.  Proficiency with C++ should be aimed
towards comfortable use of the template meta-programming features of
the language, although it is entirely possible to spend an entire
career writing C++ without exercising this feature (just read the ROOT
source code). 
*** Pointers
[[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/cdescent/][Required Reading: The Descent to C]]

As C++ has evolved from C, it retains parts of C's low level nature.
Part of this is the need to be explicit about managing memory
manually.  This is in stark contrast to languages such as Java or
Python where memory management is handled for the programmer.

A consequence of this is the ability to address specific cells of
memory (the smallest accessible unit, typically a byte).  An object
(=int=, =double=, =float=, =char=, =string=, etc) may span several
memory cells.  A pointer is the computer's representation of a memory
cell's location in memory, ie a memory address.  Ultimately the
programmer is interested in the data contained in the set of memory
cells "pointed to" by the pointer.  The act of retrieving this data is
called "/dereferencing/ a pointer".

As in physics, facility with manipulating pointers is best gained
through experience, however many analogies have been developed to ease
confusion.  One analogy is street addresses, A street address is a
sequence of numbers (the pointer) which instructs someone, a mailman
say, (the computer), how to find a specific location. Once at that
location, it is possible to manipulate objects located at that address
(deliver mail if your the mailman, break the mailbox if your a bored
teenager, knock on the door if you are a vacuum salesman etc).

Now some syntax:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  Foo* bar = new Foo("Baz",42,"What is the question?");
  std::cout << "object bar lives at memory address:"<<bar<<std::endl;
  std::cout << "bar calculated a question to the answer to \"The Ultimate Question\" as "<<bar->TheAnswer()<<std::endl;
  std::cout <<"Another way to get the answer is: "<<(*bar).TheAnswer()<<std::endl;
#+END_SRC
Lots of interesting things have been introduced here.  Let's look at a
possible output of this program:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
object bar lives at memory address: 0xd29ad0
bar calculated a question to the answer to "The Ultimate Question" as "What is 6x9?"
Another way to get the answer is: "What is 6x9?"
#+END_EXAMPLE
What happened? Let's look at the first line
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  Foo* bar = new Foo("Baz",42,"What is the question?");
#+END_SRC
=Foo*= is a pointer of type =Foo=. It's an address to a chunk of memory
that contains an instance of =Foo=.  
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Question: Why does the compiler need to know that it's a Foo type object at that address? 
#+END_QUOTE
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Answer: Foo might fall across several memory cells, in which case the
compiler must know how many memory cells to move if you ask for the
bar+1 spot. In fact, in C there is a concept called the void*, a
type-less pointer that is an address to anything.  It is the
programmer's responsibility to cast the void* to the correct type.
#+END_QUOTE

OK, so we have a pointer to an object of type =Foo= called =bar=.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Question: What happens on the right hand side of the assignment operator (=)?
#+END_QUOTE
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Answer: C++ reserves the keyword "new" for memory allocation.  The
"new" keyword takes a class constructor on the right hand side, and
returns a memory address on the left hand side.  This address gets
stored in the variable =bar=.  
#+END_QUOTE

Operationally, the "new" keyword allocates a chunk of memory to hold
the object on the right hand side, and returns a pointer to the
beginning of the chunk.  

What happens when we want to access the memory that the pointer points
to? There is another operation called "dereferencing" which goes to
the address pointed to and returns the object contained at that point
in memory.  Consider the following snippet:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
double* foo = new double(3.14159);
double pi = *foo;
std::cout <<"Pi is: "<<pi<<std::endl;
#+END_SRC
Here, a chunk of memory has the value 3.14159 written to it, then
that value is retrieved and stored in another location of memory
called =pi=.  That data is the written out the terminal by
=std::cout= and =std::endl=.

Now we can understand this line:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  std::cout <<"Another way to get the answer is: "<<(*bar).TheAnswer()<<std::endl;
#+END_SRC
It means, retrieve the object pointed to by =bar=, and call the method
"=TheAnswer()=" on it.  Programmers abhor syntax that can easily get
them into trouble, so the language designers (of c) added a shorthand
for this kind of operation (the =->= operator):
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  Foo* bar=new Foo();
  if(bar->Value()==(*bar).Value()){
    std::cout<<"They're the same!"<<std::endl;
  }
#+END_SRC
Quiz: What will the output of this snippet be?

**** Why are pointer's useful at all?
Clever hitchhikers will notice that this appears to be a bunch of
bureaucratic mucking about with pointless details, most of the time it
is.  Since most of HEP deals with pointless details bureaucratically,
a lot of HEP code uses pointers.

To understand the real purpose of pointers, we must examine [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22146094/why-should-i-use-a-pointer-rather-than-the-object-itself?newsletter%3D1&nlcode%3D47931|9e27][dynamic
allocation]]. Consider the following code:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  double* foo(){
    double* bar = new double(0.0);
  
    {
      double baz=42;
      *bar=baz;//dereference bar, and store the value of baz 
    }
    //baz is out of scope
    return bar;
  }
  int main(void){
    double* foobar=foo();
    std::cout <<"The Answer to the Ultimate question is :"<<*foobar<<std::endl;
    delete foobar;
    return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC
Let's execute the code in our mind:
1. execute =main(void)=
2. a =double*= named =foobar= is allocated.
3. =foo()= is executed
   1. a =double*= named =bar= is allocated
   2. new initializes a =double= with value 0.0
   3. new assigns the address containing that =double= to =bar=
   4. enter the braces, intialize a =double= named =baz= with value 42
   5. dereference =bar= and copy the value of =baz= into it
   6. exit the braces and free the memory where =baz= was
   7. return the address containing the value of =bar=;
4. Assign the value returned by =foo()= to =foobar=
5. stream the string "The Answer..." to stdout
6. dereference =*foobar= to obtain the value stored at =bar=, 42, stream
   that to stdout
7. add a newline to the output and flush the result to the terminal
   with =std::endl=
8. free the memory allocated for bar when foo was called.
9. return 0
10. exit the program
**** References
A similar concept present in C++ (but not c) are references.  They can
be thought of as aliases (the way Dave is an alias of David). Their
syntax is:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
int foo=42;
int& theAnswer=foo;
foo=0;
std::cout<<theAnswer<<std::endl;
#+END_SRC
Here foo is initialized to the value 42, then a reference named
theAnswer is declared and assigned to foo.  All this does is make a
new name for the same object.  What does the program output?

The answer is 0.  References seem pointless (pun intended) until
they're used in function definitions:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  void bar(int& foo){
    //complicated calculation for foo
    foo++;
  }
  int main(void){
    int baz=41;
    bar(baz);
    std::cout<<baz<<std::endl;
  }
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Question: What is the output of this program?  
#+END_QUOTE
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Answer: 42  
#+END_QUOTE

*** Methods
Methods, or functions are defined as:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  return_type function_name(arg1_type arg1, arg2_type arg2, ...){
    //statements that define function_name
  }
#+END_SRC
It is possible to "forward declare" functions, these are "promises to
the compiler" that you have a function with a particular signature:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  double foo(double,double);
  // important other stuff
  double foo(double theta, double phi){
    return sin(theta)*sin(theta) + cos(phi)*cos(phi);
  }
#+END_SRC
Notice that the compiler doesn't need to know the names of the
arguments in the forward declaration.  

Before we move onto the next topic, a note on methods.  Most of the
time during development, you only have a few helper functions.  This
is fine! Just write your helper functions in a header file, and
include them.  Write the main function and move on with your life.
There are many examples in HEP, where methods have been pigeon-holed
into classes.  The result is a cumbersome interface for the user
(YOU!) or more importantly your supervisor.  With that in mind, lets
move on to classes.
*** Classes
STOP! Read the last paragraph of the previous section.  

Now, ask yourself: Do I really need a class?  
No. Ok, great!

Yes. Are you sure?  Maybe your needs are better served with a few
functions and a well defined interface.

Do you have complicated data structures that need to be operated on
by many methods? No? Maybe your needs are better served with a few
functions and a well defined interface.

Yes? Maybe you should rethink your design.  

You've rethought it and realized that you have to use a class because
the person before you did, now there isn't a clean way to do it any
other way.  OK, classes.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Editor's Note: Our dear reader may have been studying this guide and
thought to themselves: "Gee wiz, there is a lot of great advice here,
I should follow this exactly or dragons might eat my analysis
program!"  While this may be a possibility, the previous advice on
classes may be a little, well, misguided.

More sound advice may sound like this: When beginning development,
make your first (and maybe second) drafts of the program without
classes.  This will force you to recognize which parts of your program
fit together (data+methods) and which are separate.  Then, revise your
program to include classes with the appropriate encapsulation of data
and methods.  This will ensure that you write a clean interface, and
that you don't end up with 20 methods that all take the same four
arguments.
#+END_QUOTE

The basic syntax is:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  class A{
  public:
    A():a(0),b(0){};
    A(int _a):a(_a),b(0){};
    ~A(){};
    void SetA(int new_a){a=new_a;};
    void GetA(){return a;};
    void SetB(int new_b){b=new_b;};
    void GetB(){return b;};
  private:
    int a;
  protected:
    int b;
  };
#+END_SRC
This is a trivial example, and it breaks many rules about naming
conventions and clarity.  It is not a good example.  It should not be
used as a good example to win arguments about concise code.  In fact,
you probably shouldn't have read it.

Important features of the code: Anything after the public keyword is
accessible to the outside world, ie:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
A myObj;
myObj.SetA(10);
myObj.GetA();
myObj.SetB(42);
myObj.GetB();
#+END_SRC
Is all valid code, anything that is written after private, is just
that.  You cannot access it outside of the class:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
myObj.a; //Compiler error
myObj.b; //protected is a special form of private
#+END_SRC
The protected keyword is for class inheritance.  It says that these
variables and methods are private for users of the class, but if
another class inherits from this one, they inherit these symbols. 

Normally in class inheritance, you only inherit the public members of
the class.  The private members are not inherited.  Protected offers
a way to encapsulate data, but also share data among inheritance
diagrams.

In case you haven't picked up on it, classes are one of the hairier
aspects of C++.  It's better if you refer to some other resource for a
tutorial on classes, as their subtleties are beyond the scope of The
Guide.
** An even briefer introduction to Python
Python is a wonderful language.  It is expressive and allows rapid
prototyping with a shell type environment.  [[http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/][Try learning it the hard
way]].  Another approach is to google what you're trying to do, and
make it run on a small test case.  

When writing code, it is best to be idiomatic.  This is especially
true in python.  Python's driving philosophy is "one right way" but
since python is being developed by multiple hackers, there are "many
right ways." 

Here are some references, learn python3. 
- The [[http://docs.python.org/2/howto/doanddont.html][official recommendations]] for best practices.
- [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer's_Tutorial_for_Python_3][A non-programmer's tutorial on python 3]] (also see the linked version
  for 2.7 as HEP is still using 2.7 or earlier in many cases)

*** PyROOT: ROOT bindings in python
Mostly Harmless.

** ROOT
For better or worse, for richer or poorer (always poorer), HEP
Physicists are married to (read: stuck with) ROOT.  It's the [[https://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf][Unix]] of
HEP.  There is method in the madness, though it is not clear what the
method is (just yet). The Editor is fairly certain that ROOT uses
[[https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Bistromathics][Bistromath]]ics for many of its statistical operations.

ROOT is the industry standard tool for analyzing and manipulating gobs
of data.  Other statistical analysis tools [[http://www.matthewckeller.com/html/memory.html][crash and burn]] on the
datasets that ROOT eats for breakfast.  

Recently, ROOT has begun the transition from the 5 series to the 6
series. This transition has resulted in huge changes to the front and
back-end of ROOT. Below there will be some comparisons to both
versions.  When something applies to the 5 series, it will be
annotated ROOTv5.  It should be assumed that ROOT or ROOTv6 refers to
the newest 6 series.  Without further ado, let's set it up and get to
work!
*** Installing and setting up
The ROOT devs have done a great job of documenting how to [[https://root.cern/install/][install
pre-compiled versions]] on various OS's. Sadly its not straightforward
on Debian-based (aka Ubuntu) systems. Windows binaries are available
but they're beta-use.
*** Building From source
These instructions are for *nix based systems (ie it was written for
Ubuntu, but MacOS shouldn't be much different and Windows is out of
the question).

When choosing a version of ROOT, always pick the 'pro' (pro for
production) version.  It's the latest, stable, version recommended by
the ROOT Devs. 

*Nota Bene* If you're doing this on Mac OS, you'll need to use =brew
install blah= instead of =apt-get install blah=, and the package names
will probably be different. 

If you haven't yet, read the [[*For Linux Hitchhikers][section of the guide]] relevant to your OS.

For our install of ROOT, we'll be compiling and running it locally.
This has a few advantages:
- "Uninstalling" is easy, either unset the environment variables
  pointing to ROOT, or completely delete the folder that root lives
  in (in this example =~/root=)
- Having multiple versions side-by-side is possible, you could have:
  - =~/root-clang= a version of root compiled with clang
  - =~/root-5.34= a stable version of ROOT
  - =~/root-5.99= the beta version of ROOT 6
  - To use any of them you would just have to source
    =~/root-ver/bin/thisroot.sh=
- You don't need root (administrative) access on the machine (as long
  as the pre-req's are installed).  This is generally nice since it
  decouples ROOT from the hosting OS.  

**** Getting the Pre-Requisites
Now, all of the following information is documented at [[https://root.cern.ch][root.cern.ch]],
but it is even less organized than this guide. The following is a
straight-shot from no source code to a fully working ROOT binary on a
clean install of Ubuntu (Ubuntu 21.10)

End to end, this takes ~40min on a machine circa 2011, so budget some
coffee time.  

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo apt-get install git dpkg-dev cmake g++ gcc binutils libx11-dev libxpm-dev \
       libxft-dev libxext-dev python libssl-dev  gfortran libpcre3-dev \
       xlibmesa-glu-dev libglew1.5-dev libftgl-dev \
       libmysqlclient-dev libfftw3-dev libcfitsio-dev \
       graphviz-dev libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev \
       libldap2-dev python-dev libxml2-dev libkrb5-dev \
       libgsl0-dev qtwebengine5-dev
#+END_SRC
This takes about 1gb of disk space. You may have some of these
packages already if you've installed =build-essential= or =git= before. In
either case, =apt= is smart enough to see that and not re-install them.

The above list of packages are for a full-blown, all-features-enabled
version of ROOT. If you want a stripped down version, you'll have to
get the pre-reqs from [[http://root.cern.ch]].

**** May the Source be with you
Let's get a copy of the source:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone http://root.cern.ch/git/root.git
cd root
#+END_SRC

For future reference, if you want to update:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git pull
git tag -l 
git checkout -b tag-name tag-name
#+END_SRC
=git tag -l= lists all the available tags, choose the one you want
and substitute it for =tag-name=

For now, lets checkout the latest pro branch:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout -b $(git tag -l | tail -n 1) $(git tag -l | tail -n 1)
#+END_SRC
This will checkout the branch latest stable tag and give it the
same name. This assumes that when the ROOT devs tag a branch its for
stable production use... but the prescription is future proof. If
you're new to "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control_systems][version control systems]]", or "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_management][source control
management]]" then it's useful to do a tutorial to learn the basics. HEP
and open source projects have mostly migrated to git.
**** Building 
ROOT uses cmake to build now.  Its slightly more straightforward, and
much quicker but it has some idiosyncrasies.  Specifically (and not
explicitly spelled out in the ROOT docs), cmake *requires* three
separate spaces, a place for build artifacts (object files and
libraries), a place for the source code (that is managed by git), and
an install target.  Traditionally the install target is somewhere in
the system directories where other programs are installed. In ROOT's
case, there are many situations where it is necessary to have multiple
versions available on one system.  The ROOT devs created a
'=thisroot.sh=' script which when sourced into a user's shell session,
makes the =root= in that folder the currently active one.  It does this
by setting appropriate environment variables that instruct the
operating system to search the external directories for programs and
required libraries.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# assumes we're in the root source directory
mkdir -p root_build root_install; 
cd root_build; 
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../root_install/ ../
#+END_SRC
After configuring you should see:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
...
Install path    /home/username/root/root_install
...
-- Enabled support for:  asimage builtin_afterimage builtin_clang builtin_cling builtin_gl2ps builtin_llvm builtin_lz4 builtin_lzma builtin_nlohmannjson builtin_openui5 builtin_tbb builtin_vdt builtin_xrootd builtin_xxhash clad dataframe exceptions fftw3 fitsio gdml http imt mathmore mlp minuit2 mysql opengl pyroot roofit webgui root7 rpath runtime_cxxmodules shared ssl tmva tmva-cpu spectrum vdt x11 xml xrootd
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /home/username/root/root_build
#+END_EXAMPLE
After cmake runs, it creates a Makefile for the rest of the build
process. Make sure the install path is pointing to root_install, if
its pointing to =/usr/local= you'll need administrator privileges to
install, and it'll be harder to uninstall cleanly.  Now you're ready
to build:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make -j $(cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | cut -d ':' -f 2 | tail -n 1)
#+END_SRC

The =-j= option tells make how many jobs it can run simultaneously.
Without =-j=, only one job runs.  A good rule of thumb is to choose
the number of cores you have on your computer.  If you are compiling
on remote computer, it is probably shared by others, in which it is
good etiquette to run your jobs single threaded.  On your laptop, you
should choose *one less* than the number of cores you have (so you
don't notice a slow-down while its building in the background).

See =man make= and look under the option "-j [jobs]" for more detailed
information about this switch. Some software doesn't like being built
in parallel. If a build fails (root won't) run it without the '=-j='
option.

This will take (depending on your hardware (even in 2022)) between
20-45min, so now is a good time for a cup of tea, or coffee with your
[[*Keeping your Guru happy][editor guru]].

When it's finished, it will print out:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[lots of boring crap]

[100%] Linking CXX executable ../../bin/hist2workspace
[100%] Built target hist2workspace
#+END_EXAMPLE
If you do not get this output, but the build just ends with =[lots of
boring crap]= find a senior grad student and have them look at the
=[lots of boring crap]= (it won't be boring to them). They will be
able to instruct you on what went wrong. 

If you don't have a senior grad student handy, try googling some of
the output and seeing if you can get anywhere.  There is also the
[[https://root-forum.cern.ch/][ROOT Talk Forums]].  

Finally, you need to 'install' root.  
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make install
#+END_SRC

**** Using your new superpower
Now, when you want to use =root=, you can run the command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
source ~/root/root_install/bin/thisroot.sh
#+END_SRC
If you are using tcsh (you shouldn't be) you would need to run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
source ~/root/root_install/bin/thisroot.csh
#+END_SRC

There are differing opinions about whether or not you should put
something like this in your bashrc.  One school of thought (especially
applicable when you bounce between different versions) is that you
should keep your environment as clean as possible and only setup what
you need.  In that case adding:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
alias setupROOT='source ${HOME}/root/root_install/bin/thisroot.sh'
#+END_SRC
To your =~/.bashrc= file is enough.

Then, whenever you need root, you have to run =setupROOT=, before you
can run =root=.

Another school of thought is that, you should always have some copy
of root available if possible.  In that case the following will
always setup root when bash runs if the setup file exists:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
[ -f ~/root/root_install/bin/thisroot.sh ] && source ~/root/root_install/bin/thisroot.sh
#+END_SRC

Now you can start root by typing =root= at the command line.  You
should see:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

*** Getting Started with xrootd

It appears that xrootd is built with root by default. If you want to
be able to access files hosted at CERN, you'll have to have a kerberos
client installed (either =krb5-user= or =heimdal-clients= on debian or
ubuntu systems). Then before connecting, run =kinit -5
${CERN_USER}@CERN.CH= to generate a kerberos certificate.

This might be a little in the weeds, but if your event processing
bandwidth is smaller than the network bandwidth you can achieve the
same performance as a local file-system without needing to copy large
data sets locally.  Of course there are lots of considerations, not
least of which where your machine is relative to the data on the network.

*** A Path to ROOT enlightenment
There are three methods of running code through ROOT to produce
results.  These methods are listed below, each more sophisticated
than the last.  They also include example code intended as a starting
point for hacking.   

As a reminder, see [[Obtaining a copy and supporting material]] for
instructions on obtaining and running the example code.
**** Level 1: Macros
The first, and simplest way to execute ROOT related code is the
humble macro. A macro is a set of ROOT commands enclosed by
braces. For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  {
    TFile* file= TFile::Open("MeaningOfLife.root");
    TH1F* hist = (TH1F*)file->Get("Hist1");
    cout << hist->GetNbinsX() <<endl;
  }
#+END_SRC
*For ROOT 6:*
ROOTv6 macros are compiled with the LLVM backend "just in time"
(JIT). This means that you have to type valid C++ in order to make
things work correctly.  This alleviates a lot of the issues that make
Macros fragile, and so it is easier to transition from Level 1 to
Level 2, and you can achieve more with a macro than before.

*For ROOT 5:*
While not immediately obvious, ROOTv5 macros are not written in C or
C++, but [[https://root.cern.ch/root/html534/guides/users-guide/CINT.html][CINT]]. CINT covers "most of"   ANSI C and ISO C++ 2003.
There are some important differences:
- =foo.blah= and =foo->blah= are interchangeable
- a semicolon ';' at the end of a line is optional
- No need to "=#include=" headers
As you progress in writing more sophisticated C++, you will run into
CINT's shortcomings as a C++ interpreter.  It is recommended that you
move to Level 2 or 3 before this happens. 

While it is possible to write complicated CINT macros (files with
multiple function definitions) it is not recommended.  CINT has a
habit of keeping up the appearance of doing one thing when in reality
something entirely different is happening "behind the scenes".

CINT is best used for quick scripts to plot histograms already saved
to a disk, or to inspect a few branches from a =TTree=.  More
sophisticated analyses are better served by Levels 2 and 3. 

**** Level 2: Compiled Macros
Compiled macros are full-blown C++ programs.  Generally there is a
"steering macro" that handles compiling and loading the required
libraries.  An example steering macro:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
{
  //may need to load other libraries or files that depend on analysis.C
  gROOT->ProcessLine(".L analysis.C++");
  gROOT->ProcessLine("doAnalysis()");
}
#+END_SRC
The compiled macro itself looks more like a traditional C++ program:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include "TFile.h"
#include "TH1F.h"

int doAnalysis(){
  
  return 42;
}
#+END_SRC
Since the ROOT binary already defines a "main" an error will occur
if you redefine another function named "main", therefore we use
the verb "doAnalysis". 

The steering macro that compiles each source file can become
arbitrarily complex.  To some this may read "flexible", to others it
may read "disorganized".  If your analysis grows into a multi-file
program, it's probably time to ascend to Level 3.

**** Level 3: Compiled Programs
A compiled program is just that. Here ROOT takes the role of a rich
set of libraries for composing a C++ based analysis.  

An example program (and supporting Makefile) [[https://github.com/dmb2/hitchhikers-guide-to-hep/tree/master/compiled-program][is included here]].

Makefiles come with their own overhead, but the =make= system is very
powerful.  The [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html][make manual]] is very readable with many examples.  

**** A note on Enlightenment
Master Foo, of [[http://www.catb.org/~esr//writings/unix-koans/][Rootless Root]], gives the [[http://www.catb.org/~esr//writings/unix-koans/shell-tools.html][sage advice]]:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"When you are hungry, eat; when you are thirsty, drink; when you are tired, sleep."
#+END_QUOTE

To spell it out (and to prevent the reader from enlightenment), it is
wise to choose the use of ROOT which is most appropriate for a task
at hand.  The practicing HEP physicist is proficient with all three
levels, and can pick and choose which approach is best for the task
at hand.  

*** PyROOT
PyROOT are a set of python bindings to ROOT. It works fairly well out
of the box, but there are some things to keep in mind. 
- Idiomatic python avoids "=from ROOT import *=", prefer "=from ROOT
  import blah="
- the ROOT devs know you aren't going to be idiomatic, so instead
  they've implemented a lazy loading system (ROOT is huge, so "=from
  ROOT import *=" would take forever).  This may be confusing if your
  a python expert and expect exploration commands like =dir()= to
  work with ROOT.
- If performance matters, try to stay in C++ land (ie call C++
  functions from python) as much as possible
  - If performance really matters, write it in python and then port
    it to C++. This is fairly advanced, but not impossible. You'll
    have to generate CINT dictionaries for your source files.
If you're looking for a more "pythonic" (not my word) experience,
maybe give [[http://www.rootpy.org][rootpy]] a shot. See also [[An even briefer introduction to
Python]] for resources to learn python itself.

*** Fitting Data with RooFit
RooFit is a shiny penny compared to the rest of the ROOT ecosystem.
It has its own quirks and idioms, but the interfaces are fairly
reasonable and the manual is well written.  The latest version of the
manual and quickstart can always be found here:
- [[https://root.cern/topical/][ROOT User's guide,  Roofit Manual]]
Direct links are here, though they aren't guaranteed to be current:
- [[http://root.cern.ch/download/doc/RooFit_Users_Manual_2.91-33.pdf][RooFit Manual (PDF) 2.91-33]]
- [[https://root.cern/download/doc/roofit_quickstart_3.00.pdf][RooFit Quick Start Guide (PDF) 3.00]]
*** Styling Plots 
A well designed graph is truly a work of art. The path from paltry
graphics spit out by ROOT to something worthy of framing (and yes,
[[https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters][truly amazing data visualizations are routinely framed]]) is long and
fraught with naysayers who will insist that you are doing it wrong.
Ignore them, and do what needs to be done to communicate your hard won
data clearly and concisely. To get you started, give "[[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24285628_Principles_of_Information_Display_for_Visualization_Practitioners][Principles of
Information Display for Visualization Practitioners]]" a read. It is an
executive summary of [[https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/][Edward Tufte's]] works on visualizing information.
If what you read resonates with you, then please read [[http://www.amazon.com/The-Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142][Tufte's books]].
They make for delightful coffee time distractions. After reading his
books you will start to see his influence in particularly nice
graphics. You will also see many sins committed by other
practitioners. Choose your role-models wisely.

Sage advice (passed down from The Editor's first mentor):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When you make a plot, take the time to make it publication quality
and reproducible.  
#+END_QUOTE
This means two things:
1. Make it good enough to go into a paper
2. Prefer generating it with C++/Python over any other format (data
   inputs will frequently change at the last minute, and being able to
   "hit a button" and get the plot is very useful unless you have a
   room full of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Turk][Mechanical Turks]] lying around)

This also means it's probably a good idea to keep =*.root= files
containing your histograms for last minute style changes if you are
writing a presentation.

Producing a publication quality plot can be challenging, however ROOT
includes the concept of a "Style" which can be applied.  These are
global rules for how plots should be printed.  In previous versions of
ROOT, the default style was notoriously bad.  In The Editor's humble
opinion, this was done to simultaneously encourage each physicist to
set their own standard, and to immediately identify ROOT newbies from
seasoned ROOT hackers.

Now, things are better, though the idea that "each physicist set their
own standard" has stuck, and so there are many styles floating
around. 
**** Example Style
An example style (probably from the CMS TDR, the details are lost to
time):
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
{
  TStyle *tdrStyle = new TStyle("tdrStyle","Style for P-TDR");

  cout << "TDR Style initialized" << endl;

// For the canvas:
  tdrStyle->SetCanvasBorderMode(0);
  tdrStyle->SetCanvasColor(kWhite);
  tdrStyle->SetCanvasDefH(600); //Height of canvas
  tdrStyle->SetCanvasDefW(600); //Width of canvas
  tdrStyle->SetCanvasDefX(0);   //Position on screen
  tdrStyle->SetCanvasDefY(0);

// For the Pad:
  tdrStyle->SetPadBorderMode(0);
  // tdrStyle->SetPadBorderSize(Width_t size = 1);
  tdrStyle->SetPadColor(kWhite);
  tdrStyle->SetPadGridX(false);
  tdrStyle->SetPadGridY(false);
  tdrStyle->SetGridColor(0);
  tdrStyle->SetGridStyle(3);
  tdrStyle->SetGridWidth(1);

// For the frame:
  tdrStyle->SetFrameBorderMode(0);
  tdrStyle->SetFrameBorderSize(1);
  tdrStyle->SetFrameFillColor(0);
  tdrStyle->SetFrameFillStyle(0);
  tdrStyle->SetFrameLineColor(1);
  tdrStyle->SetFrameLineStyle(1);
  tdrStyle->SetFrameLineWidth(1);

// For the histo:
  // tdrStyle->SetHistFillColor(1);
  // tdrStyle->SetHistFillStyle(0);
  tdrStyle->SetHistLineColor(1);
  tdrStyle->SetHistLineStyle(0);
  tdrStyle->SetHistLineWidth(1);

  tdrStyle->SetEndErrorSize(2);
  //tdrStyle->SetErrorMarker(20);
  tdrStyle->SetErrorX(0.);
  
  tdrStyle->SetMarkerStyle(20);

//For the fit/function:
  tdrStyle->SetOptFit(1);
  tdrStyle->SetFitFormat("5.4g");
  tdrStyle->SetFuncColor(2);
  tdrStyle->SetFuncStyle(1);
  tdrStyle->SetFuncWidth(1);

//For the date:
  tdrStyle->SetOptDate(0);
  // tdrStyle->SetDateX(Float_t x = 0.01);
  // tdrStyle->SetDateY(Float_t y = 0.01);

// For the statistics box:
  tdrStyle->SetOptFile(0);
  tdrStyle->SetOptStat(0); // To display the mean and RMS:   SetOptStat("mr");
  tdrStyle->SetStatColor(kWhite);
  tdrStyle->SetStatFont(42);
  tdrStyle->SetStatFontSize(0.025);
  tdrStyle->SetStatTextColor(1);
  tdrStyle->SetStatFormat("6.4g");
  tdrStyle->SetStatBorderSize(1);
  tdrStyle->SetStatH(0.1);
  tdrStyle->SetStatW(0.15);
  // tdrStyle->SetStatStyle(Style_t style = 1001);
  // tdrStyle->SetStatX(Float_t x = 0);
  // tdrStyle->SetStatY(Float_t y = 0);

// Margins:
  tdrStyle->SetPadTopMargin(0.15);
  tdrStyle->SetPadBottomMargin(0.13);
  tdrStyle->SetPadLeftMargin(0.13);
  tdrStyle->SetPadRightMargin(0.15);

// For the Global title:

//  tdrStyle->SetOptTitle(0);
  tdrStyle->SetTitleFont(42);
  tdrStyle->SetTitleColor(1);
  tdrStyle->SetTitleTextColor(1);
  tdrStyle->SetTitleFillColor(10);
  tdrStyle->SetTitleFontSize(0.05);
  // tdrStyle->SetTitleH(0); // Set the height of the title box
  // tdrStyle->SetTitleW(0); // Set the width of the title box
  // tdrStyle->SetTitleX(0); // Set the position of the title box
  // tdrStyle->SetTitleY(0.985); // Set the position of the title box
  // tdrStyle->SetTitleStyle(Style_t style = 1001);
  // tdrStyle->SetTitleBorderSize(2);

// For the axis titles:

  tdrStyle->SetTitleColor(1, "XYZ");
  tdrStyle->SetTitleFont(42, "XYZ");
  tdrStyle->SetTitleSize(0.06, "XYZ");
// The inconsistency is great!
  tdrStyle->SetTitleXOffset(1.0);
  tdrStyle->SetTitleOffset(1.5, "Y"); 

// For the axis labels:

  tdrStyle->SetLabelColor(1, "XYZ");
  tdrStyle->SetLabelFont(42, "XYZ");
  tdrStyle->SetLabelOffset(0.007, "XYZ");
  tdrStyle->SetLabelSize(0.05, "XYZ");

// For the axis:

  tdrStyle->SetAxisColor(1, "XYZ");
  tdrStyle->SetStripDecimals(kTRUE);
  tdrStyle->SetTickLength(0.03, "XYZ");
  tdrStyle->SetNdivisions(510, "XYZ");
  tdrStyle->SetPadTickX(1);  // To get tick marks on the opposite side of the frame
  tdrStyle->SetPadTickY(1);

// Change for log plots:
  tdrStyle->SetOptLogx(0);
  tdrStyle->SetOptLogy(0);
  tdrStyle->SetOptLogz(0);

  tdrStyle->SetPalette(1,0);
  tdrStyle->cd();
}
#+END_SRC
If your working with one of the major experiments, they'll most
likely have a style for you to use  (It will invariably be 95% the
same as above, but the 5% will make *all* the difference). 

**** Transparent Plots
Add this to your =~/.rootrc= (or create it if it doesn't exist):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Flag to set CanvasPreferGL via gStyle
OpenGL.CanvasPreferGL:                      1
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now, in your plotting code:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
TColor* color = gROOT->GetColor(TColor::GetColor(red,green,blue));//Use ints from 0 to 255 
color->SetAlpha(0.5);//0 is fully transparent, 1 fully opaque
hist->SetFillColor(color->GetNumber());
#+END_SRC
Is this a clean interface? No, but it can be just what your graphic
needs to remain clear without cluttering the canvas with hatching. 

Two warnings:  
1. As of this writing, this is only supported for "popular" output
   formats (pdf, svg, gif, jpg, and png), though notably *not*
   postscript (ie ps). 
2. It's very easy to create a shade that cannot be properly rendered
   on a projector, making the transparent component of your plots
   invisible.

*** Extending ROOT with custom classes
Sometimes it is useful to add your own developed classes to ROOT (so
they can be used in ROOT macros/PyROOT scripts or so they can be
stored in a ROOT file). For example you may have a class of the form
(in a file called CustomEvent.h, for example):
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  #ifndef CustomEvent_h
  #define CustomEvent_h

  #include "TObject.h"

  class CustomEvent : public TObject {
    ClassDef(CustomEvent,1);
  private:
    int    _eventID;
    double _eventEnergy;
  public:
    CustomEvent() {}
    virtual ~CustomEvent() {}

    void set_eventID(const int eid);
    void set_eventEnergy(const double e);

    int eventID() const { return _eventID; }
    double eventEnergy() const { return _eventEnergy; }
  };

  #endif
#+END_SRC
It is a good idea to inherit from TObject if you require reading or
writing objects to disk.  Official documentation of the ins and outs
of adding classes can be found in Chapter 15 of the [[https://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/root-users-guide-534][User's Guide]], as
well as information here: [[https://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/interacting-shared-libraries-rootcint][cint]] and [[https://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/adding-your-class-root-classdef][ClassDef]].  We also need
CustomEvent.cxx:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
#include "CustomEvent.h"

CustomEvent::CustomEvent() {}
CustomEvent::~CustomEvent() {}

void CustomEvent::set_eventID(const int eid) { _eventID = eid; }
void CustomEvent::set_eventEnergy(const double e) { _eventEnergy = e; }

#+END_SRC
To make this class accessible within (Py)ROOT you must create a LinkDef.h file
of the form:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
#ifdef __CINT__
#pragma link off all globals;
#pragma link off all classes;
#pragma link off all functions;

#pragma link C++ class CustomEvent+;

#endif
#+END_SRC
Now you must generate a dictionary for the class:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rootcint -f CustomEventDictionary.cxx -c CustomEvent.h LinkDef.h
#+END_SRC
This generates =CustomEventDictionary.cxx= and
=CustomEventDictionary.h=. Now you can compile the source for your
class and the new dictionary source. Then finally link them together
in a library:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
g++ -fPIC -c CustomEvent.cxx `root-config --cflags`
g++ -fPIC -c CustomEventDictionary.cxx `root-config --cflags`
g++ -shared -o libCustomEvent.so CustomEvent.o CustomEventDictionary.o `root-config --glibs`
#+END_SRC
Now by loading the library libCustomEvent.so you can use your class
within ROOT. For example, the macro:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
{
  gSystem->Load("libCustomEvent");
  CustomEvent a;
  a.set_eventID(42);
  std::cout << a.eventID() << std::endl;
}
#+END_SRC
*** Important Gotcha's 
At some point you'll get stuck.  Hopefully you'll be stuck on a good
problem, but more often than not you'll be stuck on some quirk that
ROOT has.  Remember ROOT's mantra: "[[http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/f/feature.html][It's not a bug, it's a feature]]!"

ROOT's object protocol is very strange.  The [[https://root.cern/TaligentDocs/TaligentOnline/DocumentRoot/1.0/Docs/books/WM/WM_63.html#HEADING77][naming schema]] is based on
an industry standard for C programs where it's not possible to use
namespaces. The result is very confusing for new users (very good for
HEP).  Every object in root that can be written to disk (ie saved in a
ROOT file) derives from a =TObject= base class.  This base class
defines a protocol for objects. (All objects can print themselves,
have a name, have a title, have a class name, etc).  This makes it
possible to have a list of disparate objects (as long as it's a list of
=TObject*=).  As you gain more experience with ROOT, this becomes
a power tool.  Like any power tool ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Home_Improvement_characters#Tim_Taylor][as Tim Taylor can attest]]), this
can be abused to no end. 

**** TTrees
***** Drawing trees
When you call =TTree::Draw= to draw multi-dimensional histograms, the
order of the axes is "z:y:x" rather than the expected "x:y:z"
***** Caching trees
Use =TTreeCache= to loop over trees rather than the standard
=TTree::GetEntry(i)= idiom.  A =TTreeCache= learns which branches you
access most often and caches them, speeding up your processing time
significantly. [[http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TTreeCache.html][Documentation here]].  Since you won't read to the end
(no one does...) here is the docs for when *not* to use a
=TTreeCache=:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    SPECIAL CASES WHERE TreeCache should not be activated


   When reading only a small fraction of all entries such that not all branch
   buffers are read, it might be faster to run without a cache.


   HOW TO VERIFY That the TreeCache has been used and check its performance


  Once your analysis loop has terminated, you can access/print the number
  of effective system reads for a given file with a code like
  (where TFile* f is a pointer to your file)

   printf("Reading %lld bytes in %d transactions\n",f->GetBytesRead(),  f->GetReadCalls());
#+END_EXAMPLE
***** Splitting Trees
If you want to split a TTree into $n$ statistically independent
parts use something like:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
TTree* outTree=tree->CopyTree("Entry$%n==i");
#+END_SRC
Here, =n= is the number of parts requested, =i= is the i'th part.  If
you're just splitting it in half, a full blown macro (from the
trenches) would look like:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
// A macro to split a tree
{
  TFile* file=TFile::Open("./merged_dijets.root");
  TTree* tree=(TTree*)file->Get("micro");
  TFile* fileA=new TFile("UnfoldingStudy.dijets-pt1.root","RECREATE");
  fileA->cd();
  TTree* treeA=tree->CopyTree("Entry$%2==0");
  treeA->Write();
  fileA->Write();
  fileA->Close();
  TFile* fileB=new TFile("UnfoldingStudy.dijets-pt2.root","RECREATE");
  fileB->cd();
  TTree* treeB=tree->CopyTree("Entry$%2==1");
  treeB->Write();
  fileB->Write();
  fileB->Close();
  
}
#+END_SRC
**** TH1
Despite the name, TH1 is the base class for all histograms.  This can
lead to much [[http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2012:Losing][!FUN!]]. Be extra wary of null pointers when handling
TH1's of unknown origin.  
**** TH2
***** Splitting a 2D 
One would expect an interface method like =TH2D::Split()=, but instead
you need to use the appropriate THStack [[http://root.cern.ch/root/html/THStack.html#THStack:THStack@2][constructor]]:
=THStack(const TH1* hist, Option_t* axis = "x", ...)=

Then call =THStack::GetHists= to get a TList of the histograms.  Of
course, you'll have to use [[http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TList.html][ROOT's idioms for iterating over lists]],

Another, slightly more direct option is =TH2::ProjectionX()= and
=TH2::ProjectionY()=, used in the following fashion:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  std::vector<TH1D*> split_list;
  for(size_t i = 1; i < Hist2D->GetNbinsX()+1; i++) {
    split_list.push_back(Hist2D->ProjectionY("_py",i,i+1,"e"));
  }
#+END_SRC
Depending on your ROOT version, you may have to change the ="_py"=
string to be something unique.  This can be done as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  std::vector<TH1D*> split_list;
  char buff[256];
  for(size_t i = 1; i < Hist2D->GetNbinsX()+1; i++) {
    snprintf(buff,sizeof(buff)/sizeof(*buff),"%s_%u_py",Hist2D->GetName(),i);
    split_list.push_back(Hist2D->ProjectionY(buff,i,i+1,"e"));
  }
#+END_SRC
User Beware: not using a unique name can cause unexpected behavior
when drawing the list of slices.  
**** THStack
=THStack= is not mostly harmless. In fact, if you want to do reasonable
things with =THStack=, it probably won't work, and if it does, it may
work once and not the second time.  If you can avoid =THStack=, then do
it.  
***** Get Sum of Stack 
To get a histogram representing the sum of a stack use
=THStack::GetStack()->Last()=
***** A pointer here, a pointer there, who am I?
If you want to iterate over the stack, there are two ways to get the
underlying objects.  They are not equal.  Option 1:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  THStack stack = new THStack("Stack","A stack of histograms");
  // later on ...
  TIter next(stack->GetHists());
  TH1* hist = NULL;
  while((hist=dynamic_cast<TH1*>(next()))){
    // Do something with *original* histograms added to stack
  }
#+END_SRC
Option 2:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  TH1* hist = NULL;
  for(int i = 0; i < stack->GetStack()->GetEntries(); i++){
    hist = dynamic_cast<TH1*>(stack->GetStack()->At(i));
    // Do something with histograms to be painted on the canvas
  }
#+END_SRC
These two methods appear equal but are not.  The =TList= method from
=THStack::GetHists= give you the original pointers (ie those that you
added with =THStack::Add=).  The =TObjArray= method from
=THStack::GetStack= gives you the internal histograms which will be
used to draw the histograms on the canvas.
**** TFile
TFile's are greedy about object ownership.  In fact, object ownership
in ROOT is a very common +bug+ feature.  Many times you'll own objects
you thought you didn't (memory leak) or, you'll delete objects you
thought you did (double free core-dump). 

The rule of thumb to keep in mind is "TObjects declared after a file
is opened are owned by previously opened file" 

Contrast:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
TH1F hist("hist","Higgs Discovery Plot", 50,0,200);
TFile output("discovery.root","RECREATE");
output.Close();
#+END_SRC
with:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
TFile output("discovery.root","RECREATE");
TH1F hist("hist","Higgs Discovery Plot", 50,0,200);
output.Close();
#+END_SRC

In the former, the file =discovery.root= will be empty.  In the
latter, it will contain a copy of =hist=.  

This can get really hairy when you're dealing with pointers.
Therefore (instead of being a responsible programmer), the best
approach to managing memory in ROOT is to not manage it until you
have to.  
***** Recreate, create, new, update
From the ROOT docs:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
If option = NEW or CREATE   create a new file and open it for writing,
                             if the file already exists the file is
                             not opened.
           = RECREATE        create a new file, if the file already
                             exists it will be overwritten.
           = UPDATE          open an existing file for writing.
                             if no file exists, it is created.
           = READ            open an existing file for reading (default).
#+END_EXAMPLE
*Important*: Recreating will destroy the file if it exists.  BE
CAREFUL when you use this option!
**** Extracting ACLiCs compilation steps
Here's a tip you hope you never need.  The use case is when you are
writing a standalone program and you know you need to invoke rootcling
to generate dictionaries. When you follow the [[https://root.cern/manual/io_custom_classes/#using-rootcling][correct prescription]],
the produced dictionary fails even when linked to your code.  What you
can do is follow the "[[https://root.cern/manual/root_macros_and_shared_libraries/][loader.C prescription]]" and then dump what ACLiC
is doing under the hood with:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
root [7] gDebug=7
(const int)7
root [8] .L libLoader.C++
#+END_EXAMPLE
This will dump all of the g++ and rootcling calls that are required to
generate a working dictionary.
*** Debugging with ROOT
Eventually you'll encounter a segmentation fault or segfault in ROOT.
(They can also go under the name core dump).  This happens when you
try to read, write, or otherwise abuse a part of memory that doesn't
belong to you.  The result is that the program (ROOT usually)
crashes.  ROOT has gotten pretty good at realizing that this has
happened, and printing information about what was going on when the
crash happened.  
**** A "crash" course on reading a stack trace
Here's a stack trace from a real-live analysis program (SFrame in this
case)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE



===========================================================
There was a crash.
This is the entire stack trace of all threads:

#+END_EXAMPLE
The numbered lines followed by the memory address (the 64bit hex
numbers) represent the order in which each function was called.  The
most recent call is at the top of the list.  Since this code was
running a single thread, there is a only one stack trace. If there
were multiple threads, there would be a trace for each
thread. Typically the fastest route to a user called function is to
look at the portion:

#+END_EXAMPLE

This strips out the system calls that clutter the full trace, and the
top frame (#5 in this case) is the last function called that was
defined (=UnfoldingStudy::ExecuteEvent=).  This means that somewhere in
that function, someone tried to access memory they shouldn't have.  

You can trace the whole program from the =main()= invocation.  To
gain more insight into all the information contained in the stack
trace, it is very useful to go through a =gdb= tutorial.  

Also, see [[Getting Help]] for more problem solving strategies before
filing a bug report.  Remember: you probably just found a feature,
not a bug.   

**** Using gdb
Here are some good gdb (GNU DeBugger) tutorials 
- [[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gilpin/tutorial/][Debugging under Unix: gdb Tutorial]]
- [[http://www.unknownroad.com/rtfm/gdbtut/gdbtoc.html][RMS's gdb Debugger Tutorial]] (not the same [[http://stallman.org/][RMS]])
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/][GDB manual]] from GNU.org

**** Valgrind
If you have memory related problems, you should be aware of
[[http://valgrind.org][valgrind]].  The [[http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/QuickStart.html][quick-start is here]].

** Physics
At some point (not necessarily right away) a hitchhiker will want to
better understand the physics underlying the research he/she is
doing.  There are numerous textbooks on the subject, but a few stand
out as particularly good.
- [[http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Elementary-Particles-David-Griffiths/dp/3527406018/ref%3Dpd_sim_b_1?ie%3DUTF8&refRID%3D1S6X949W6P9EM9E95V8A][Introduction to Elementary Particles 2nd Ed.]] - David Griffiths
- [[http://www.amazon.com/Quarks-Leptons-Introductory-Particle-Physics/dp/0471887412][Quarks and Leptons: An Introductory Course in Modern Particle]]
  Physics - Francis Halzen and Alan D. Martin
*** Study Guide For Griffiths
If you've never touched HEP or heard of Particle Physics, read
chapter 1 and 2.  Otherwise here's a rough path through the book (with
suggested exercises to work):
- Chapter 3 (Problems 3.4, 3.14 (for fun), 3.15, 3.16, 3.25, 3.26
  (last two cover Mandelstam variables, which are very useful tools))
- Chapter 6 (Problems 6.8 or 6.9, 6.12, 6.13, 6.14, 6.15)
- Chapter 7 (Problems 7.6, 7.8 (optional), 7.14, 7.23, 7.30, 7.36,
  7.37, 7.39, 7.51)
- Chapter 8 (Problems 8.14, 8.15, 8.16, 8.19, 8.23, 8.28)
- Chapter 9 (Problems 9.2, 9.3, 9.6, 9.14, 9.17, 9.20, 9.23, 9.25,
  9.31, 9.32)
- Chapter 10 (Problems 10.4 10.5, 10.6, 10.15, 10.16, 10.21, 10.23)

Halzen and Martin has a better treatment of Quantum Chromodynamics,
but that just adds another book to your library.  

This assumes the reader has covered the material in chapter 4 in a
undergraduate quantum course (at the level of Griffiths).  Chapter 4
is too much of a review to be useful as a primary source.  Griffith's
quantum book covers it, but Townsend's "A Modern Approach to Quantum
Mechanics" is a better text to have on your bookshelf.

*** Coordinate Systems used in HEP
HEP uses cylindrical coordinates (well, a combination of cylindrical
and spherical really) with the z axis oriented along the beam line, R
radially "up" and the \phi curling right-handed around the beam axis.

In addition, HEP physicists think in terms of a variable called
"pseudorapidity" denoted \eta.  This is defined as 
$$
\eta = - \log\left(\tan\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
$$
Where \theta is the polar angle from the beam azis. Why use this
crazy coordinate system? Well, it's related to rapidity,  the
relativistic counterpart to speed.  More important to HEP experiments,
/differences/ in pseudorapidity are Lorentz invariant /along the beam
axis/.  

If you want to keep a mental map of angles (from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorapidity][wikipedia]]):
|--------+-------------------------------------------|
|   \eta | Location                                  |
|--------+-------------------------------------------|
|      0 | "Straight up" (\theta=\pi/2)              |
|   0.88 | "Forty Five Degrees" (\theta=\pi/4)       |
|    4.5 | "Along the Beam Pipe" (\theta=2$^\circ$ ) |
| \infty | "Beam Axis" (\theta=0)                    |
|--------+-------------------------------------------|




*** Monte Carlo Event Weights
This is taken from The Editor's Lab Notebook (which is locked by a
password, and hence will only be read by one person):

Someone generates gobs of MC for use in any analysis for some process
( $W\rightarrow \mu\nu+p$ where $p$ is a parton).  I want to study what
a variable will look like in data, so I run my analysis over the MC
and get a plot out.  Then I run the same code over data and plot the
two on top of each other.  The trouble is that the number of MC events
I ran over is not the same as the amount of data I ran over.  Now the
problem becomes how to appropriately scale the Monte Carlo prediction
to match the data (the result of the experiment).

As experimental high energy physicists, we define variables so that we
can relate the cross sections predicted by theory to what we measure
out of the beam.  To this end, we can get the number of expected
events from
\begin{equation}
N_{D}=\sigma \mathcal{L}
\end{equation}
Here $\sigma$ is the cross section in barns (typically pico-barns) and
$\mathcal{L}$ is the integrated luminosity collected by the
experiment. How do we compare this to the Monte Carlo prediction?
There, the computer counts up the number of events that were generated
for a specific process, what we want is
\begin{equation}
N_{exp}=W N_{MC}
\end{equation}
Here $N_{exp}$ is the expected number of events we get from Data.  In
order to compare data to MC we need to scale $N_{exp}$ to the same
order as $N_{D}$.  Remember, there is a cross section calculated from
theory that the MC prediction used, therefore we can write
\begin{equation}
N_{exp}=\sigma_{MC}\mathcal{L}
\end{equation}
It is possible that $\sigma_{MC}$ is corrected to the next order.  In
order to avoid recalculating everything, a $k$ factor is reported as
the ratio of $\sigma_{NLO}/\sigma_{MC}$.  Then all you have to do is
multiply $\sigma_{MC}$ by the $k$ factor, and the calculation is
updated to the newest NLO prediction.

We're interested in the weight, so
\begin{equation}
W=\frac{\sigma_{MC}k\mathcal{L}}{N_{MC}}
\end{equation}
Now, when each bin in the Monte Carlo histogram is scaled by W, it
will be equal to the theoretically expected yield calculated by
$\sigma_{MC}k$.


*** Drawing Feynman Diagrams Digitally
There are many possibilities. The most "user friendly" is probably
[[http://jaxodraw.sourceforge.net/][JaxoDraw]].  It's even got a name reminiscent of Douglas Adams!

JaxoDraw comes as a jar file, you may want to make it more command
line friendly by making a script to invoke it (put this in
=${HOME}/local/bin/jaxodraw=):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/bash
java -jar ${HOME}/local/lib/java/jaxodraw-2.1-0.jar $@
#+END_SRC
Now make it executable:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chmod +x ${HOME}/local/bin/jaxodraw
#+END_SRC
And add it to your =PATH=. I have my path set up to search this path
from my =.bashrc=:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
export PATH=${HOME}/local/bin:$PATH
#+END_SRC
Now to test it out by typing =jaxodraw= at the command prompt, it should
just launch. If it doesn't try again.

Someday you may be working on a presentation and want the figures
exported by jaxodraw to have a transparent background.  Some kind soul
has hacked the conversion steps to do this for you. You can grab the
scripts here:
http://personal.psu.edu/jcc8//jd-conversions/

If you have jaxodraw setup as above you can just dump the scripts in
=$HOME/local/bin= and run them on the xml file produced by jaxodraw.

*** What to do if you've lost a 2\pi
Calm down, take a deep breath and read the first line of The Guide.
Then come back here.  Somewhere a fellow grad student has a copy of
"Introduction to Elementary Particles (2nd Edition)" by David
Griffiths.  Read Chapter 6 in entirety paying special note to the
footnote on page 205.  
** Responsible Research
This is a topic better covered else where.  The part that overlaps
with this guide is in documenting the work you do.  It is important
that you keep a traceable paper-trail of everything you do.

*** Lab Notebooks
When keeping a lab notebook, it is important to make the barrier for
writing something down as small as possible.  If it's difficult or
inconvenient, you will not be inclined to document as well as you should.
**** Pen/Paper Notebook
This is the Science standard, and it is perfectly applicable to HEP
research. Keep it open and write in it as you work.  Make sure there
is a 1-to-1 mapping from what you are writing in your notebook and
what can be found on a hard drive somewhere (plots, text, code etc).
**** Org-mode Notebook
The Editor keeps an org-mode notebook.  There is a [[https://github.com/dmb2/research-log][thorough write-up
here]]. (Editor's note: I always wanted to flesh this out, but it became
a joke to link to the repo and let it lie.)
**** Flat text file
One option is to keep a (well organized) text file for recording what
you're doing.  Paste links and your thoughts here.  Choose a markdown
language and write your posts in that.  This way you are forced to
keep more structure in the file, and you can export to whatever
output formats are supported by your markdown language.
**** Wiki/ELog
Some research groups reserve webspace for hosting private
e-logs. These are typically wiki syntax, but they can also be
bulletin board style formatting.  In any case, it's possible to use a
browser extension like "[[https://github.com/fregante/GhostText][Ghost Text]]"  to use your favorite
editor. One downside to these style notebooks is that it is typically
awkward to post many plots at once. 

** Getting Help
For better or worse, eventually you will get stuck.  This is
Research! If you're not stuck half the time you're not doing it
right! 

Here's a rough strategy for tackling problems:
1. Google it, don't just Google specific errors, search related terms.
   Eventually you will be able to make the search more and more
   general until you get the answer you want, try reading the [[http://www.googleguide.com/][Google
   guide]].
2. Read documentation. Many times the answer is buried deep inside
   the program.  Don't be afraid to crack open the source code and
   actually try to understand whats going on (after exhausting any
   manuals or user guides available).
3. Just take a deep breath, go get a cup of coffee and come back
   to the problem.
4. If the coffee didn't help, table the problem for the moment and
   work on something else.  Most likely when you come back to it
   (today or tomorrow) the solution will be obvious.
   - Now may be an appropriate time for an email to the person you
     are working with directly.  Chances are they've already
     encountered and solved your problem.
5. If you're still stuck, it may be time to post to a forum or mailing
   list.  In general, when soliciting help from people you don't
   know, it is polite to avoid contacting them directly.
   - Above all else, *do not* be a [[http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/][help vampire]].  (They do exist!)

** FAQ
- I tried: =#include <TheAnswerIsFortyTwo.h>= in C++ but it
  doesn't work, what gives?
In short: "=#include <...>=" instructs the compiler to look in
specific system include directories.  In contrast '=#include= "=...="'
instructs the compiler to look in all directories that it can find
(usually specified with the =-I= flag). ([[http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/43444/][Further information]])
- I was typing along and all of the sudden my terminal froze!? The
  only way to continue was to exit the program! 
Most likely you accidentally typed "C-s" (the control key followed by
the s key). This sends the XOFF command to your terminal emulator.
To fix it (and "unfreeze" your terminal) type "C-q". [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_flow_control][More Info Here]].
- I have some information that would be useful for your guide, can
  you use it?
Yes! Please see [[https://github.com/dmb2/hitchhikers-guide-to-hep#contributing][Contributing]]. 
- I'm lost and confused, your guide is overwhelming and overbearing,
  but I really like HEP, what can I do?
Please don't despair, with time things will come into focus.  In the
mean time, it will probably be useful to seek out other sources of
information.  If you're having trouble finding material, you might
try the [[http://www.googleguide.com/][Google guide]].  
- I have a question not covered by this FAQ that doesn't involve a
  research problem, whats the best way to communicate it to you?  
You can email me at [[mailto:hhg-svc@ccbar.us][hhg-svc@ccbar.us]]. If it is related to some
technical issue and you already have a GitHub account, please open an
issue on GitHub's issue [[https://github.com/dmb2/hitchhikers-guide-to-hep/issues][tracker for this text]].
